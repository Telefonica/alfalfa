# alfalfa [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/alfalfa.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/alfalfa) ![Typescript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-.ts-blue.svg)

*Opinionated startup for node applications. Get rid of boilerplate.*

> Alfalfa comes from Alpha. _Because this will become the very beginning of every Node.js service you create_

## Usage

```js
const alfalfa = require('alfalfa');
const express = require('express');
const http = require('http');
const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;

const config = require('./config');

let app = express(); // use your favorite framework
let server = http.createServer(app); // your app will be exposed as an http server
let client = new MongoClient();

// Create a startup way to bring up your service
let startup = new alfalfa.Startup();

// Check some preconditions before starting
startup.check(() => config.validate());

// Configure the runners you want to use
startup.use(new alfalfa.ServerRunner({ server, port: 3000 }));
startup.use(new alfalfa.MongoRunner({ client, uri: 'mongodb://localhost:27017/alfalfa' }));

startup.bootstap(); // Yeah!
```

What's is going on here? Alfalfa bootstraps your app by starting each one of the runners defined.
Each runner is a proven block that saves you from writing boilerplate and error-prone code again and again.
There are several runners available. More on this can be found in the [example folder](example/).

Moreover, alfafa also prints traces for monitoring the startup, and manages the operating system
signals and unhandled exceptions/rejections.

```sh
node server.js
