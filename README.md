# alfalfa [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/alfalfa.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/alfalfa) ![Typescript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-.ts-blue.svg)

*Opinionated startup for node applications. Get rid of boilerplate.*

> Alfalfa comes from Alpha. _Because this will become the very beginning of every Node.js service you create_

## Usage

```js
const express = require('express');
const http = require('http');
const alfalfa = require('alfalfa');

const config = require('./config');

let app = express(); // use your favorite framework
let server = http.createServer(app); // your app will be exposed as an http server

// Create a startup way to bring up your service
let startup = new alfalfa.Startup();

// Configure the runners you want to use
startup.use(new alfalfa.ConfigRunner(config));
startup.use(new alfalfa.ServerRunner({ server, port: 3000 }));

startup.bootstap(); // Yeah!
```

What's is going on here? Alfalfa bootstraps your app by starting each one of the runners defined. Each runner is a proven block that saves you from writing boilerplate and error-prone code again and again. There are several runners available. More on this can be found in the [example folder](example/).

Moreover, alfafa also prints traces for monitoring the startup, and manages the operating system signals and unhandled exceptions/rejections.


```sh
node server.js

INFO  Server listening { address: '::', family: 'IPv6', port: 3000 }
INFO  Service ready
^Crtl-C
WARN  Stopping service
INFO  Ordered shutdown
INFO  Server closed
````

## Available Runners

### ServerRunner
Runs a node server in the specified port. Features:
 - Adds listeners to the server to print the server lifecycle, allowing monitorization.
 - Adds support for a graceful shutdown, with a 10s grace period.

### ConfigRunner
Takes care of the app configuration. Features:
- Validates that the configuration is valid. It merely be used as a pre-condition check to other runners.
- The configuration module must have a `validate()` method that throws when the validation didn't succeed

### MongoRunner
Comming soon. Will take care of the database connection.
