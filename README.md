# alfalfa [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/alfalfa.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/alfalfa) ![Typescript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-.ts-blue.svg)

*Opinionated startup for node applications. Get rid of boilerplate.*

> Alfalfa comes from Alpha. _Because this will become the very beginning of every Node.js service you create_

## Usage

```js
import alfalfa from 'alfalfa';
import express from 'express';
import http from 'http';

const app = express();

let app = express(); // use your favorite framework
let server = http.createServer(app); // your app will be exposed as an http server
let agent = new http.Agent({ keepAlive: true });

// Create a startup way to bring up your service
let startup = alfalfa.Startup();

// Check some preconditions before starting

// Configure the runners you want to use
startup.use(alfalfa.AgentRunner({ agent }));
startup.use(alfalfa.ServerRunner({ server, port: 3000 }));

startup.bootstap('Service'); // Yeah! Create the process with title 'Service'
```

What's is going on here? Alfalfa bootstraps your app by starting each one of the runners defined.
Each runner is a proven block that saves you from writing boilerplate and error-prone code again and again.
There are several runners available. More on this can be found in the [example folder](./example/).

Moreover, alfafa also prints traces for monitoring the startup, and manages the operating system
signals and unhandled exceptions/rejections/warnings.

```sh
node server.js

HTTPServer listening on http://0.0.0.0:3001
HTTPServer ready
MyService ready
<-- Crtl-C
Stopping MyService. SIGINT received
Stopping HTTPServer
Stopping HTTPAgent
MyService stopped
````

## Available Runners

### ServerRunner
Starts a node server in the specified port. Features:
 - Adds listeners to the server to print its lifecycle, allowing monitorization.
 - Adds support for a graceful shutdown, with a 9.5s grace period.

### AgentRunner
Tracks a KeepAlived [http.Agent](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_new_agent_options). Features:
 - Destroys the keep alived sokets when the service shutdows
